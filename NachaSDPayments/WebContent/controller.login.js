/*
 * Angular injections allow you to use other AngularJS modules/controllers/services/etc in your
 * code. In this controller, I'm injecting $scope and the DatabaseService service. I don't know
 * everything that $scope does, but what's really important about it is that any variable named
 * $scope.<variable_name> can be accessed from the controller's connected HTML file. This includes functions
 * as well. If you declare normal JavaScript variables, they will be limited to use in the controller
 * only. On the whole, injections are INCREDIBLY picky about syntax. You MUST declare your injections
 * in an array like this, with the last array element being the function, or you will run into errors.
